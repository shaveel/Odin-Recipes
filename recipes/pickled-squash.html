    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Set some of that abundant summer squash aside for the winter months with this awesome pickled squash recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds young yellow squash and zucchini, sliced into rounds</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips</li>
        <li>2 small onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mustard seed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery seed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large non-aluminum pot, combine the squash, bell pepper, and onions. Cover with salt, and let stand for 2
             hours to release the liquids. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Just before the 2 hours are up, combine the sugar, vinegar, mustard seed, turmeric and celery seed in a saucepan.
             Bring to a boil. Drain the salty liquid from the vegetables. Pour the spice brine over the vegetables, and let 
             stand for 2 more hours.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil once again, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Ladle into 1 pint sterile jars, filling with the liquid 
            to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe rims with a clean towel, and run a thin spatula around the inside of the jar 
            to remove air bubbles. Seal with lids and rings. Process for 10 minutes in a simmering 
            water bath to seal completely.</li>
    </ol>
